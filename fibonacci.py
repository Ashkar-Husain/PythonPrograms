''' Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 to 50.  
Note : The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers :
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ....
Every next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
'''
n = 50;
x = 0
y = 1
z= 0
while z <= n:
    print(z)
    x=y
    y=z
    z = x + y;
